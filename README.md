About ]po[ Data Warehouse Light :

<p><strong><span class="brand"><span class="brandsec"></span><span class="brandfirst"></span><span class="brandsec"></span></span></strong>Data Warehouse &quot;Light&quot; is a reporting tool implemented using Microsoft Excel and its &quot;Pivot Table&quot; functionality. There are no sacrifices in functional operability, the &quot;light&quot; only refers to the limit on the data size, which can handle up 65,000 records, due to the limitations of Microsoft Excel. Data stored within the ]project-database[ is exported and then formatted to be read by Microsoft Excel, allowing companies to view and study their financial records stored within ]project-open[ using a third party software, Excel. This package is closed source and currently only available through its commercial purchase at the <a href="http://www.project-open.com/en/shop/index.html|Project"><a href="http://www.project-open.com/en/shop/index.html">Project-Open Store<span class="external"> </span></a>.</a><p><p>
